            <h2>From The Critics</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Jordan writes with the stark vision of light and darkness,
                    and sometimes childish sense of wonder, that permeates J.R.R.
                    Tolkien's works. His style is undebatably his own.

                <p>A great read... Some surprising new developments... I can't
                    recommend starting anywhere but at the beginning, but the volumes
                    only get richer as they go along.
